# Git Branching Strategy

This project follows a structured branching strategy for organized development and collaboration.

## Branch Naming Convention

- **Feature branches**: `feature/<description>` or `feature/issue-<number>-<description>`
- **Bug fix branches**: `fix/<description>` or `fix/issue-<number>-<description>`
- **Hotfix branches**: `hotfix/<description>` (for urgent production fixes)
- **Refactor branches**: `refactor/<description>`
- **Documentation branches**: `docs/<description>`

Examples:
- `fix/issue-2-manual-code-login`
- `feature/add-filament-export`
- `refactor/database-service`

## Workflow

1. **Create a branch** from `main` for each issue/feature
2. **Make commits** with clear, descriptive messages following conventional commits:
   - `fix:` for bug fixes
   - `feat:` for new features
   - `refactor:` for code refactoring
   - `docs:` for documentation changes
   - `chore:` for maintenance tasks
3. **Push the branch** and create a Pull Request
4. **Reference issues** in PR description with `Fixes #<issue-number>`
5. **Merge to main** after review/approval

## Commit Message Format

```
<type>: <short description>

<optional longer description>

Fixes #<issue-number>
```

## Main Branch Protection

- `main` branch should always be deployable
- Direct commits to `main` are discouraged
- All changes should go through Pull Requests
