# Git Branching Strategy

This project follows a structured branching strategy for organized development and collaboration.

## Branch Naming Convention

- **Feature branches**: `feature/<description>` or `feature/issue-<number>-<description>`
- **Bug fix branches**: `fix/<description>` or `fix/issue-<number>-<description>`
- **Hotfix branches**: `hotfix/<description>` (for urgent production fixes)
- **Refactor branches**: `refactor/<description>`
- **Documentation branches**: `docs/<description>`

Examples:
- `fix/issue-2-manual-code-login`
- `feature/add-filament-export`
- `refactor/database-service`

## Workflow

1. **Sync with origin/main** before starting work:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```
2. **Create a branch** from `main` for each issue/feature
3. **Make commits** with clear, descriptive messages following conventional commits:
   - `fix:` for bug fixes
   - `feat:` for new features
   - `refactor:` for code refactoring
   - `docs:` for documentation changes
   - `chore:` for maintenance tasks
4. **Before pushing**, rebase on latest origin/main:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git rebase origin/main
   ```
5. **Push the branch** and create a Pull Request
6. **Reference issues** in PR description with `Fixes #<issue-number>`
7. **Merge to main** after review/approval

## Issue Workflow (Required)

When starting work on a GitHub issue:

1. **Always rebase** with latest `origin/main` before creating your branch
2. **Create the feature/fix branch** following naming conventions
3. **Implement the changes** with proper commits
4. **Rebase again** before pushing to ensure branch is up to date
5. **Create a Pull Request** after implementation is complete
   - Link to the issue using `Fixes #<issue-number>` in the PR body
   - This auto-closes the issue when PR is merged

## Commit Message Format

```
<type>: <short description>

<optional longer description>

Fixes #<issue-number>
```

## Main Branch Protection

- `main` branch should always be deployable
- Direct commits to `main` are discouraged
- All changes should go through Pull Requests
